<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to provide a simple interface for selecting
feature isotope pairs in an untargeted metabolomics dataset.

## Installation

**If running on windows:** Make sure you have Rtools install before
installing the isotopes package. You can download Rtools from
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). \*\*

You can install the development version of isotope from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("JohanLassen/isotopes")
```

## Once installed you need one line to begin the analysis

It doesnâ€™t require any arguments, as it opens an app which informs you
about the next steps.

``` r
isotope::run_app()
```
